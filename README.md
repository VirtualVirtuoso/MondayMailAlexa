# Monday Mail Alexa Skill

This little project is my venture into creating Amazon Alexa Skills.

The Monday Mail is a newsletter which is released from the School of Computer Science, from the University of Manchester. 
It's of a very consistent format, and I'm a hater of emails, so this works.

## Planned Features

* *"Is there anything happening at the university today?"*
* *"Tell me what is happening this week"*
* *"Is there anything happening on Wednesday?*

## Licence

This project is covered by the MIT licence. In other words, you may do with it what you want, as long as you don't blame
me for anything which breaks on your computer.
